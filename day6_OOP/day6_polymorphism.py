print(f"---------- POLYMORPHISM ----------")

""" Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the ability of an object or function
    to take on multiple forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of the same class, 
    enabling the use of a single interface to represent a variety of different types. 
    This allows for more flexible and scalable code, as well as increased code reusability. """
