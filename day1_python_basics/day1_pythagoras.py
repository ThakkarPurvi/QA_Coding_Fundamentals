Part 3 - Pythagoras
Create a program called Pythagoras.py that can return the long angled side of a right angled triangle. Pythagoras’ Theorem states that the
square of the long side (C) of a right-angled triangle is the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides (A and B).

The user should be able to implement the lengths of sides A and B to return the length of C.
Stretch goal – You should use an input statement to allow the user to choose which side to calculate (A, B or C) and run the correct sum.
Lab 3 – Iteration Lab
Task 1 – Using While Loops
Part 1 - Squares
Add a new file called Squares.py and add the following to it:
number = 1
while number < 100:
    numberSqr = number * number
    print(numberSqr)
    number += 1
When this code runs it prints the square of each number from 1 -100.
Add an if statement to end the loop if the square of a number is greater than 2000.
Part 2 - Investment
Create a file called Investment.py, this file should Calculates how many years it will take an initial investment of £100 to grow to a target value of £1000 if the interest rate is 10%. This program should use while loops to achieve the result.
Stretch goal – Make the program more usable by allowing the user to input values for: initial investment, target value and interest rate.
Part 3 – Count Vowels
Create a file called CountVowels.py that returns the number of vowels in a given word. The user should be able to input a word (as a string) and count the number of vowels (A,E,I,O,U) in said word.

Stretch goal – The user can enter 3 additional letters into the program that it will then check for, and return the total number of found letters. I.e the user enters B, P, T and also enters BURRITO, it should return 5 (B, U, I, T, O).
